## About

In this project, we learn about how to make a binary search tree.
This data structure is where you take a group of data items and turn them into a tree full of nodes where each left node is “lower” than each right node. The tree starts with the “root node” and any node with no children is called a “leaf node”. I also learned about tree traversal algorithms like breadth-first and depth-first.
